This project is a Book Recommendation System written in Python (Flask). It uses the goodbooks-10k-master book dataset from kaggle and BX-csv Dataset from informatix.* The program uses Pandas, flask, scipy, numpy, etc (Python data analysis library) to work with the datasets. The program uses an algorithm called ‘k-nearest neighbors (KNN)’ to find similar books to recommend. The program allows the user to enter the title of the book they have read. Then it will show the books similar to that book and also their authors, ratings of the book.
